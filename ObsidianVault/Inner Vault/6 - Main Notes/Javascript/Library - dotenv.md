#JavaScript

A library created to manage multiple environment variables on the project. 

### Advantages vs relying on plain .env

Using the dotenv library instead of just relying on a plain .env file with process.resources (or manually loading environment variables) offers several advantages:

#### Automatic Parsing and Loading

_dotenv_ automatically reads your .env file and loads the variables into process.env. Without it, you would need to manually read the file and parse it.

#### Consistency Across Environments

Works seamlessly across different operating systems without needing extra shell commands.
Ensures that all team members load environment variables the same way.

####  Security and Ease of Use

Keeps secrets and configurations out of source code while making them easy to manage. Prevents accidental overwrites by allowing default values.

#### Supports Different Environments

Libraries like dotenv-flow allow managing multiple .env files for different environments (.env.development, .env.production, etc.).

#### Zero Dependency on the Execution Context

Some platforms may not support environment variables as expected (e.g., Windows vs. Linux). _dotenv_ abstracts away these inconsistencies.

#### Better Debugging and Error Handling

Provides features like .config({ path: "custom.env" }) for explicit loading. Helps diagnose missing or misconfigured environment variables.
