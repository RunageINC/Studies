The way of communication on [[World Wide Web (www)]]. The most famous protocol, which is the HTTP protocol, is the foundation of how it communicates over systems, through requests for pages and resources.

## HTTP

This protocol is a standarized set of rules of how the communication will work. Everything that connects through an HTTP or any other protocol goes through a [[Web Server]], which are machines that receives a request and provides a response to that request.

### Request/Response cycle

When we request something at some URL, we receive a response for that resource. This response can be any type of content, from JSON responses to full web pages, etc.
The response is then interpreted by the browser/requester and can be worked through.
