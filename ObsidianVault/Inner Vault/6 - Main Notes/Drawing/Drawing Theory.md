Basically composed of 3 things:

1. Shapes
2. Forms
3. Details


## Shapes

2D objects, that serves as the basis:

## Forms

3D shapes with multiple sides

- Spheres
- Blocks

## Details

Textures, materials, color, anything that gives life

The main pyramid of those three things are:

This is theoretically. But in pratice, we have something more like that:

Details are more of a refined process where clean lines, little details, all of this enters.

From a viewers perspective, this is the most common:

Viewers do not see shapes when admiring a piece of art. This is where most beginners struggle, because how we see things is different of how we make things and that by itself is different from theory

A good way to understand better proportions and things like that is to draw lines on already existing pieces, to better understand the shapes and forms.
