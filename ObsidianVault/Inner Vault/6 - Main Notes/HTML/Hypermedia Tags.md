### Image tag

The image tag renders a new image after a source. This source works like the anchor tag, being it a local source or a link reference to an image. It can also carry a **width** and **height** directly on the tag. This is a **self enclosing tag**, which means that it does not need a close tag because it closes on itself.

It is a good practice to have an **alt** for when the image does not load.

```HTML
<img src="img.jpg" alt="image example of things" />
```
