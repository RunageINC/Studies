Domain-Driven Design is a separation pattern for software architecture.


### Bounded Context

Bounded context are basically a way of software segregation in a similar manner of how we separate sectors from an enterprise, and navigate through a communication between them. The most basic example for a Bounded Context to be applied is through a school system:

Imagining that we are projecting a software for a school. We have some separated areas:

| Location  | User    |
| --------- | ------- |
| Classroom | Student |
| Finances  | Parents |

In real life, people often give different names for things. On DDD, the business/domain language is called ubiquous language.
