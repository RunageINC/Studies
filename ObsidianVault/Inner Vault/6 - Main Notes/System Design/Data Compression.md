### Introduction

When transmitting data over network, the size of the data is important to consider, especially in distributed systems.

The larger the payload = more bandwidth to process it, increased latency and impact on system performance.

There are many algorithms that compresses data to transfer it over the network and it is a common way of reducing latency.

The benefits of compressing data are:

- Cost saving
- Reduced bandwidth usage
- Improved Latency
- Efficient resource utilization
