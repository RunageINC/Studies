What actually are going into the region. Each region have many availability zones, but usually it is 3 with a maximum of 6.

For example, the Syndey (ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º ) region code is *ap-southeast-2*. We have 3 availability zones in Sydney: *ap-southeast-2A*, *ap-southeast-2B* and *ap-southeast-2C*. 

Each availability zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and conectivity, isolating them from disasters (redundancy practices on hardware).
