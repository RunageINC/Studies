Below, there are the explanations of the 2 main folders. I did not add a README on them just like the other ones because they are explicitly serving a main purpose.

## 1 - Rough Notes & Ideas

Any note, idea, project, anything fast you need to jot down just for remembering later.

Write things you do not want to forget. Just like a list or something.
## 2 - Source Material Folder and How Does it Work

This folder is to write any inside from what you consume.

Podcasts, blogs, posts, medium posts, anything goes.

- [I] You can even do  subfolders to better organize the ideas, for example: Books, Papers, Tweets, Blogs, etc

- [!] Try to keep active notes, notes that you are not sure or not finished reading, unsorted, out of any folder.
## 3 - Tags Folder and How Does it Work

Store tags here, to use it later on. To create a linked mentions, just press `Cmd + P` and type **linked mentions** so it can actually search for backlinks on each tag.
## 4 - Indexes Folder and How Does it Work

Helps on navigate through tags. By organizing tags that has a lot of things linked to it, we can create subheadings and move all the tags to this index, creating a better way of searching through the maze of your second network.
## 5 - Templates Folder and How Does it Work

Stores template for notes. Create all your templates here so you can apply them on new notes with `Cmd + P` and typing **Templates**
## 6 - Main Notes Folder and How Does it Work

This goes all the main _Atomic Notes_. By not attaching it to any folder, and only using tags, we are currently using the principle of *Zettelkasten*. 

Every single main note goes here, maintaining the system flexible and open to connections.
