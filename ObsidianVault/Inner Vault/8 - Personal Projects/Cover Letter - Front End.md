It is a pleasure to introduce myself. My name is Arthur Gomes, and I am a PwD software engineer with an MBA in Full Stack Development and Engineering. Currently contributing to Mercado Livre, I bring a wealth of experience from my tenure at IBM, where I spearheaded the development of a CRM system from scratch to enhance sales performance. My work spans diverse functionalities, from implementing seamless integrations with Module Federation to architecting complex recursive search solutions in Spring Boot.

I am deeply passionate about front-end development, a domain where I thrive as both a creator and a mentor. Alongside my technical expertise, I have a strong background in knowledge sharing, having taught PwD students foundational algorithms and mentored junior and mid-level professionals in their journey with React. My focus extends beyond technical skills, fostering creative problem-solving and innovative thinking among my peers.

In my current role, I lead the development and business knowledge-sharing efforts for our CRM application while ensuring its ongoing support and functionality. This includes proactively engaging with users to address their needs and deliver impactful solutions.

I am confident that my technical acumen, coupled with my enthusiasm for collaboration and teaching, will make me a valuable asset to your team. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your project goals while fostering an inclusive and dynamic work environment.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your needs and am eager to contribute to your success.

Best regards,
Arthur Gomes
