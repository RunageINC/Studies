I love to study, teach and arts. Those are 3 pillars from me that are incredibly strong. Everything I do touches one of those 3 areas.

Working with something I study, which is technology, is great.

Teaching and helping others fill my soul.

Relieving my mind with something I love is needed, which is art (music and draw).

What keeps me from doing what I love the most:

- Lack of needed money
    - I want to help and give confort to specific people. This is part of my “helping others”.
    - Also, I would love to do charity, and help other people that I don't know.
- Lack of motivation
    - Sometimes, I get too stuck on what should I do.
    - The lack of a plan an discipline makes me feel like shit and losing motivation.
- Anxiety
    - Sometimes I feel too anxious and nervous over things.
    - Sometimes I cannot even think straight, or create things that do not exist.
    - Most of my anxiety feelings are made out of fear.
        - Fear of being abandoned
        - Fear of lose something
        - Fear of not being able to help
        - Fear of not knowing
        - Fear of disappoint the ones I care about
- Attachment
    - I get attached to people very often. Being it in a relationship, friends or even situation.
    - Sometimes this attachment creates an hyperfocus on me.
        - I can focus on helping too much someone I love
        - I can focus on some specific subject (Yu-Gi-Oh, Technology, etc).

### How to Solve

- Lack of needed money
    - Keeping track of expenses
    - Start to avoid money pitfalls (games, stuff that is not needed)
- Lack of motivation
    - Organize the room. It is very important to keep everything clean so the ideas can properly flow
    - Create a plan
        - This plan must adapt with my needs and how I work.
        - It cannot be too straight, as I am not a strict person.
        - It should vary on subjects, due to the versatility of my brain
    - Meditate
        - Return the meditation schedule. Keeping the focus and lowering the anxiety.
        - Start to inner scan better and properly
    - Physical Training
        - Very important for study and for relief of stress and anxiety
        - Good for self esteem
- Anxiety
    - Meditate once more. This is a topic that should have never be left on my life, giving the circumstances.
        - Create a meditation routine to focus.
        - Start with basic nothing very strict. Until it becomes natural as training is right now.
    - Plan something with your friends
        - Be surrounded by people better than you (and happier)
    - Fears (in general)
        - Make a retrospective of your life. Know your value.
            - Sometimes, some fears can be healed by knowing who you really are.
            - Accept that sometimes you are unable to help
                - What about your needs? Who helps you every single time? No one because it is humanly impossible.
            - Accept your weaknesses
                - Knowledge gaps, strength weaknesses. Turn those into your strengths.
                - OBS: Shadow from Carl Jung
        - Read more
            - Knowledge is power, and power is confidence (and also money)
- Attachment
    - That should not be a problem. Unless you are attaching to someone one-sided.
        - Beware of who you are attaching.
        - Be real about your connections. This has nothing to do with not being yourself, but to be present to people as much as they are to you. Nothing more, nothing less.
        - Don't accept anything.


- Face the chaos in your head. You're not fixing everything today but you're starting
- Prioritize.
- The power of one tiny habit
- Declutter your space/brain. Clear space
- Digital detox from yt
- Break up with toxicity (inner critic)
- Learn to say no without apologizing
- Body - the original luxury vehicle
- Financial checkup
- Find your morning power move
- Celebrate small wins
- Progress - not perfection.
