To learn complex skills, we have a few steps for latent learning period.

The most important things that we can consider to learn complex skills forever is

- Trial and Error
- Experimenting

The most important question is:

> Am i moving to the right direction?

To answer this question, we use the **RAIL** framework.

- [[R]]
- [[A]]
- [[I]]
- [[L]]

#### Why RAIL works?

RAIL is derived of another competency model design called 4 stages of competence, where you have:

1. Unconscious Incompetence
2. Conscious Incompetence
3. Conscious Competence
4. Unconscious Competence
