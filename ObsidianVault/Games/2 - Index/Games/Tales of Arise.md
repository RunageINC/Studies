Game starts with enlsaved people by Renan's soldier. The protagonist seems to be some important figure called "[[Iron Mask]]".  He seem not to feel any pain.

He saves Kohl at the beginning, from the soldier's punishment but gets hurt by parrying the sword with his body. He proceeds to see the Doc afterwards.

In the middle of the treatment, [[Iron Mask]] says that he does not remember anything nor feel any pain, only the urge of fighting for others.

All the people seem to have an oval-shaped metal plate on the hand. All of them but the [[Iron Mask]]. Seems to be called [[Spirit Core]].

On the next day, all slaves seems to be pushing some kind of train. This train carries something and gets attacked by explosive bombs. Seems to be a group of "thieves" that attacks the carriage and tries to rescue a girl.

When one of them (a guy) touches the girl, the guy gets electrified and is pushed away. The girl does not seem to be a commoneer and uses the opportunity to run away.

The girl eventually fall under a carriage and meets the main character, which helps her with escaping from the soldiers.

[[Iron Mask]] seems to be capable to handle both of the them until helps arrives from the previous "thieves". The cart explodes and the party gets thrown at somewhere.

In the meantime [[Balseph]] discovers that the girl escaped and started punishing the soldiers. With this, we learn that her name is [[Shionne]].

The lords does not seem to have a healthy relationship.

The group is then identified as [[Crimson Crows]]. 

[[Zephyr]] starts to investigate [[Shionne]] to see why [[Balseph]] was after her. After the investigation, they discover that they've been ambushed.

The [[Iron Mask]] then receives a [[Dull Sword]] for helping with the combat.
