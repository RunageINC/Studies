First known as [[Iron Mask]], Alphen actually has no memories of himself at the beginning of the journey.

He saves Kohl at the beginning, from the soldier's punishment but gets hurt by parrying the sword with his body. He proceeds to see the Doc afterwards.

In the middle of the treatment, he says that he does not remember anything nor feel any pain, only the urge of fighting for others.

All the people seem to have an oval-shaped metal plate on the hand, called [[Spirit Core]]. All of them but him. Later on the journey, he meets Shionne and the two fight together with the Crimson Crows to escape from the soldiers of Rana.

He eventually awakes at the Crimson Crow place and starts to fight his way out with the crew against the same soldiers, who ambushed everyone.
