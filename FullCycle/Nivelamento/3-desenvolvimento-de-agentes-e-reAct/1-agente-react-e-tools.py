    Use the following format:

    Question: the input question you must answer
    Thought: you should always think about what to do
    Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
    Action Input: the input to the action

    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

    Rules:
    - If you choose an Action, do NOT include Final Answer in the same step.
    - After Action and Action Input, stop and wait for Observation.
    - Never search the internet. Only use the tools provided.
